        <h2>Basic Info</h2>
        
        <p>I want to say this right away: <em>I am not a survivalist expert.</em> I'm a guy who wants to help <em>people teach themselves</em> how to be survivalist experts. I want people to take the intitative to gather information on COVID-19's direct and indirect attacks on people and society, and find ways to overcome them. I see all the coffins, unemployment numbers, hospitalizations, and closed businesses in America and abroad, and I wanted to do more than just cower in my closet. I wanted to give people ideas on surviving this, and inspire others to do the same.</p>
        
        <p> In a time of COVID-19, lockdowns, hurting economies, uncertain futures, etc..., knowledge and survival are now more important than ever. For America and the world to survive, people need to know how to do things for themselves that they used to go out to do, and pay other people to do. "But how do I do that" you may ask? That's why this website exists, to help people learn how to survive a pandemic, and help others survive too.</p>
    
	    <p>Feel free to look at the various articles below, and share them with people you know who might need them. The best weapon humanity has in the war on COVID-19 and its variants, is knowledge.</p>
